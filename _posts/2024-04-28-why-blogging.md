When relaunching my new website, I wondered, after such a long time of silence, what should come first as the topic. Then I decided to write this article.

The main idea of this post is adopted from a Chinese blogger -- [MindHacks](http://mindhacks.cn)（Weipeng Liu, 刘未鹏）. In his article, he spotlighted how beneficial it could be to keep ***a valuable blog*** and successfully persuaded me to write my first blog many years ago.

Now I want to write those reasons down and let this post serve as review of his article and a reminder to help me keep in mind why I started blogging and what I am blogging for. Hopefully, just as I was influenced by MindHacks, I also wish this post could probably inspire some of you to start your own journey of content creation and enjoy the goodies that blogging might bring you.

## So, why blogging?

In one word, according to MindHacks, *blogging can bring **numerous benefits** but **no obvious downsides***. In other word, *using the form of a blog to record your **valuable thoughts** can bring many benefits without any obvious downsides.*

In this context, blogging is not random musings, trivial mood notes, idle chatter, or filling the void with words, but a result or summary of your thinking. With this being said, I think you might already have get some sense of how beneficial blogging could be.

## Benefits of Blogging
Maintaining a long-term valuable blog can bring a lot of benefits, including

1. Find mind-like friends
   
2. Writing is for better thinking 
   
3. Teaching is the best way to learn (Feymann learning) 
   Feymann techniques
4. Discussion promotes
   
5. Motivates continuous learning and thinking
   
6. Learn to keep consistency
   against lazyness
7. A different kind of resume
   show your self get to know who you are, what you care, ... better than a A4 paper

Extra bonus:
1. Notes
   don't have to solve the problem again
   It always happens to me before...
2. if you write in a foreign language
  For me, English is not my mother tongue, blogging ...

## Okay, but How?
If you understand ... you shouldn't raise this question ...
natural process, recording of thinking, s
sort out, complete and summerize ...
keep learning and thinking, thoughts and, every thing will come...

(like the phrase: do what )

easier said than done

## Get the Stones out of the Way
You might find stones in the way, possible solutions.

make it into a habit

Much of will is skill.
1. no value for others
2. naive or being laughed

If you're a perfectionist like me
