## Why I Write This Post
When relaunching my new website, I wondered, after such a long time of silence, what should come first as the topic. Then I decided to write this article.

The main idea of this post is adopted from a Chinese blogger -- [MindHacks](http://mindhacks.cn)（刘未鹏）. In his article, he spotlighted how beneficial it could be to keep a valuable blog and successfully persuaded me to write my first blog many years ago.

Now at the moment of celebration, I want to write down the reasons why I started blogging to let this post serve as reminder to help me keep on going even when I'm feeling tierd. And As I'm influenced by his posts. I also hope some of you could also be inspired by me to start your journey of content creating and get the benefits ...

Teaching is the Best Form of Learning

Now you decide to start blogging, but how?

easier said than done

I have a

I am going to 
My plan is to post biweekly, since my workload. Consistency.

You might find stones in the way, possible solutions.

## Get the Stones out of the Way

Much of will is skill.
1. no value for others
2. naive or being laughed

If you're a perfectionist like me
