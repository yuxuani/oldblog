When relaunching my new website, I wondered, after such a long time of silence, what should come first as the topic. Then I decided to write this article.

The main idea of this post is adopted from a Chinese blogger -- [MindHacks](http://mindhacks.cn)（Weipeng Liu, 刘未鹏）. In his article, he spotlighted how beneficial it could be to keep *a valuable blog* and successfully persuaded me to write my first blog many years ago.

Now I want to write those reasons down and let this post serve as review of his article and a reminder to help me keep in mind why I started blogging and what I am blogging for. Hopefully, just as I was influenced by MindHacks, I also wish this post could probably inspire some of you to start your own journey of content creation and enjoy the goodies that blogging might bring you.

## So, why blogging?

In one word, according to MindHacks, *blogging can bring **numerous benefits** but **no obvious downsides***. In other word, *using the form of a blog to record your **valuable thoughts** can bring many benefits without any obvious downsides.*

In this context, blogging is not expressing random musings, trivial mood notes, idle chatter, or filling the void with words, but a result or summary of your thinking. With this being said, I think you might already have get some sense of how beneficial blogging could be.

## Benefits of Blogging
Here I want to list 10 of the main advantages of maintaining a long-term valuable blog. Some of them are adopted from the original article.

### 1. Record valuable thoughts
Yes, writing the ideas down is beneficial. Like sparkles, if you don't record them right away, they will disappear very quickly. You are losing the wealth of your thoughts!

What I think of ...
1.  Take notes down
   don't have to solve the problem again
   It always happens to me before...

### 2. Writing helps better thinking
writing organizes your thoughts, deeper 

### 3. Motivate continuous learning and thinking

### 4. Learn to keep consistency
   against lazyness

### 5. Teaching is the best way to learn 
If you've heard the Feynman technique, you'll know what I'm talking about. If you can't 

### 6. Find mind-like friends
Nowadays, many people like to extend their circle of friends through the internet. However, how to find mind-like friends on the internet and how to determine if others share the common ground? It's quite hard to achieve this through daily grumbling on the social network sites. 

But blog is different. If you share valuable thoughts, you will attract people of the same mind. The information you shared on the internet is not only useful for you and the readers but also helps to build a deep understanding. Moreover, maintaining a long-term valuable blog make it possible to make friends who share the same values and beliefs, fostering deeper connections. 

It even has much greater potential than traditional ways of making friends.

### 7. One to all: Efficiency in disseminating information
> Blogging greatly enhances the **reusability** of discourse.

I really like the sentence that MindHacks: 

Perfect, right?

Where blogging outerperforms the traditional way of making friends is not only breaking geographical limiations. 

Normally, if you want to get to know someone, you need to first start to the chat, share your ideas, exchange views and gradually build up the friendship. It is a long process and what even worse is, when you encounter someone else, you have to repeat this process again. 

might be 
do not have explain it again and again ...
in the long run reduce workload and enhance the efficiency

### 8. Discussion promotes deeper reflection
learn from the audience
talk to targeted group of people
know more
where does thoes differences come from
reveal deeper
sparkle of thoughts...

### 9. Another kind of "resume"
   context, not in the sense of a traditional resume but a window for the others to get to know who you are, what you care and
   values and beliefs and what you care, etc.
   In return, get to know people, open up the door of chances.

### 10. Writing skills and extra 
Last but not least. Don't forget the ... Writing itself, ability, productivity, writing speed, all needs practice

if you are writing in a foreign language, extra bonus.
In the meantime, you are practicing the language in the meantime. boring writing exercises ... If you do it consistently ...
thinking in this language and get to know ...

## Okay, but How?
What if I don't know what to write?

If you understand ... you shouldn't raise this question ...
natural process, recording of thinking, sort out, complete and summerize ... keep learning and thinking, thoughts and, every thing will come...(like the phrase: do what )

What if my thoughts are not valuable at all and even too naive?
If I wrote something wrong, would I be laughed by "real specialists"?
Real specialists do not do personal attack. If someone do, they are ...fake. Guidance from them. 
If someone spot out your mistake, what will happen? You learn faster! So, open up your door and thank the chances, don't refuse them.

Maintaining a long-term valuable blog is hard, what if the ideas runs out.

lack of rewards?
itself even if there is no audience. Reach out ...

1. no value for others
2. naive or being laughed

## Get the Stones out of the Way
It's always easier said than done.

You might find stones in the way, possible solutions.

make it into a habit

learning, thinking, recording.
schedule sometime for it.

Much of will is skill. 
Atomic habits...

Ready to go?
